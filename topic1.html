                            <p>Password spraying is a cyberattack technique used to gain unauthorized access to user
                                accounts or systems by systematically attempting a few commonly used or easy-to-guess
                                passwords against multiple accounts. Unlike traditional brute-force attacks that target
                                a single account with various password attempts, password spraying involves trying a
                                small number of passwords across a large number of accounts, often in a low and slow
                                manner to evade detection.
                            </p>

                            <p> The goal of password spraying is to exploit the common practice of using weak or easily
                                guessable passwords by individuals or within an organization. Attackers typically employ
                                automated tools or scripts that utilize a list of commonly used passwords, dictionary
                                words, or variations thereof. The selected passwords are typically common, such as
                                "password," "123456," or "admin," and may include slight variations like appending
                                numbers or symbols.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To mitigate the risks associated with password spraying, organizations and individuals
                                can implement the following security measures:
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>1. Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password policies that require users to
                                create
                                complex and unique passwords, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and
                                special characters.
                            </p>

                            <p>2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA, which adds an additional layer of
                                security by requiring users to provide additional authentication factors (e.g., a
                                one-time password sent to their phone) alongside their passwords.
                            </p>
